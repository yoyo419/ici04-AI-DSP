## Modification Overview

Recent versions of Unsloth use an encapsulated vLLM backend that prevents direct access to model logits through `self.model`. We modified the package to enable a hybrid approach that maintains both vLLM acceleration and direct model access, allowing users to retrieve raw model outputs while preserving inference performance benefits.

## Modified Packages

The following files have been modified:
- **`site-packages/trl/trainer/grpo_trainer.py`**: Updated trainer to support hybrid model access
- **`site-packages/unsloth_zoo/compiler.py`**: Enhanced model compilation for dual access patterns  
- **`site-packages/unsloth_zoo/rl_replacements.py`**: Modified RL components for compatibility
- **`site-packages/unsloth/rl.py`**: Only patching GRPO trainer as requested

## Important Configuration

Before using the modified environment, you need to update the cache path in `unsloth_zoo/compiler.py` and `../train.py`:

```
# Line 69 in compiler.py - Update this path to match your setup
UNSLOTH_COMPILE_LOCATION = "path/to/yours/Legal_Delta/scripts/unsloth_compiled_cache"

# Line 4 in train.py - Update this path to match your setup
UNSLOTH_CACHE_DIR = "path/to/yours/Legal_Delta/scripts/unsloth_compiled_cache"
```
